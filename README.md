# Fake Calculator

A playful twist on the classic calculator â€” this project intentionally gives **wrong answers** by applying a hidden bias to every calculation.  
Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, and hosted for free using **GitHub Pages**.

## ðŸŽ¯ Features
- Simple, clean calculator interface.
- Always returns slightly wrong results (just for fun).
- Works entirely in the browser â€” no downloads needed.
- 100% free hosting via GitHub Pages.

## ðŸš€ Live Demo

## ðŸ›  How It Works
The calculator looks normal, but behind the scenes the JavaScript code tweaks the correct result by adding or subtracting a random offset.  
This makes it fun for pranks, games, or teaching programming concepts.
